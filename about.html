        <h1 class="center">ABOUT US</h1>
        <P class="center1">We are providing best acoustical quality of the hall <br>   
            The size of the hall should be optimum, neither big nor small.<br> 
            It is small uneven distribution of sound will take place due to the formations of stationary waves.<br>
             If size is too big reverberation time will be more that results in confusion &unpleasant sound.<br>
             Reverberation time (T) should be neither too small nor too large.<br> If it is small intensity will be weak.<br>
              If large sound will be unpleasant. Thick carpets curtains, upholstered chairs, audience take care of reverberation <br>
              Use of proper absorbent material enhances the quality of sound.<br>- The regular intervals/space between staircase or railings give repeated echo, <br>
              this makes the sound unpleasant, so thick carpets take care of this & wide gaps between staircases are generally preferred.
